# OIBSIP_Task04-WineQuality

**Wine Quality Prediction Project**

**Description:** Developed machine learning models to predict wine quality based on chemical characteristics, utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithms.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Explored dataset structure, handled missing values, and removed outliers to ensure data quality and integrity.
- **Classifier Models:** Implemented Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and SVC algorithms for wine quality prediction, optimizing model performance using GridSearchCV for parameter tuning.
- **Feature Analysis:** Analyzed chemical qualities like density, acidity, and pH as predictors for wine quality, providing insights into their relationships through data visualization.
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Employed Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array operations, facilitating efficient data processing and analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the dataset, including scatter plots and count plots to illustrate relationships and distributions.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
